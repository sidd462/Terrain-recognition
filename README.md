## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- os
- cv2 (from OpenCV)
- matplotlib
- keras (version 2.12.0)
- tensorflow (version 2.12.0)

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is divided into three main categories:

- Training data
- Validation data
- Testing data

Each category contains images of different terrains. The dataset paths used in the notebook are specific to Kaggle and might need to be adjusted according to your setup.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download and organize the dataset in the following structure:
    ```
    ├── Data Main
        ├── train
            ├── TerrainType1
            ├── TerrainType2
            ...
        ├── test
            ├── TerrainType1
            ├── TerrainType2
            ...
        ├── val
            ├── TerrainType1
            ├── TerrainType2
            ...
    ```
3. Adjust the dataset paths in the code if you're not using the Kaggle environment.

## Model Architecture

The system leverages the ResNet50 architecture from TensorFlow's `keras.applications.resnet` package. Initial layers of the base model are set as non-trainable, and the latter layers are made trainable. Additional layers, including a GlobalMaxPooling2D layer and Dense layers, are added on top of the ResNet50 base model to customize it for the terrain recognition task.

---

## Training and Evaluation

1. Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation and zoom, are applied to enrich the dataset.
2. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001, categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.
3. Implement early stopping to avoid overfitting. This monitors the validation loss and stops training if it doesn't improve after a set number of epochs.
4. Train the model using the training dataset and validate using the validation dataset.

---

## Results

- The training history is saved as a CSV file named "History.csv". This file contains epoch-wise accuracy and loss for both training and validation datasets.
- Visualize the training and validation accuracy using the generated plots.
- The trained model is saved in the "Model.keras" file, which can be loaded and used for further predictions.

## Conclusion

This terrain recognition system offers a comprehensive solution for classifying different terrains using deep learning. With the given dataset and architecture, the model can be trained to recognize various terrains with high accuracy. Future work can involve expanding the dataset, exploring other architectures, and deploying the model in real-world applications.
